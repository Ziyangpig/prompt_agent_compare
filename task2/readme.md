### Running Steps:
0. Set up API keys for OpenAI in a file named `gpt3keys.txt` (one key per line)
1. bash 1.run_prepare_data.sh   
    - Prepare data for LangChain processing
    - You can adjust User_Prompt in this process
2. bash 2.run_gpt_datagen_multithread.sh
    - Uses LangChain to generate predictions with multiple threads in parallel
    - Automatically rotates API keys for error handling and load balancing
    - Resumes processing if interrupted (skips already processed items)
3. bash 3.scorer.sh
    - Calculate scores and output wrong answers to facilitate analysis
    - You can adjust Answer extraction method


### Strategy recommendation:
1. Adjust User_Prompt
    - Adjust instruction
    - Add some examples
    - ...
2. Adjust prompt template in LangChain
    - Modify the ChatPromptTemplate in langchain_datagen_multithread.py
    - Add system messages for better guidance
3. Leverage multiple rounds of dialogue
4. Conduct multiple assessments and tally preferences
5. Adjust model parameters like temperature and top_p
